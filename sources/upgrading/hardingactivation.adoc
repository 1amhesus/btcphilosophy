This page summarizes several technical proposals for activating the
taproot soft fork defined by BIPs 340, 341, and 342. The goal is to
succinctly reference the tradeoffs inherent in each class of proposals
so that the development community can choose and implement an activation
method that users will find acceptable.

Note that a common theme in many of the proposals is dealing with the
case where an insufficient percentage of hashrate signals readiness to
enforce taproot. This is a reaction to the difficulty activating segwit.
However, there is currently no indication that there will be difficulty
activating taproot---miners may offer it the same support that they
offered other non-controversial soft forks such as BIP34 height in
coinbase, BIP66 strict DER, BIP65 `+OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY+`, and BIPs
68/112/113 relative locktimes.

==== [#Notes_on_BIP8 .mw-headline]#Notes on BIP8#

At the time this document is being written,
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki[BIP8] has
been drafted based on lessons learned in 2017. One notable change
following BIPs 9+148 is that forced activation is now based on block
height rather than median time past; a second notable change is that
forced activation is a boolean parameter chosen when a soft fork’s
activation parameters are set either for the initial deployment or
updated in a later deployment.

BIP8 without forced activation is very similar to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki[BIP9]
_version bits with timeout and delay_, with the only significant
difference being BIP8’s use of block heights compared to BIP9’s use of
median time past. This setting allows the attempt to fail (but it can be
retried later).

BIP8 with forced activation concludes with a mandatory signaling period
where all blocks produced in compliance with its rules must signal
readiness for the soft fork in a way that will trigger activation in an
earlier deployment of the same soft fork with non-mandatory activation.
In other words, if node version x is released without forced activation
and, later, version y is released that successfully forces miners to
begin signaling readiness within the same time period, both versions
will begin enforcing the new consensus rules at the same time.

This flexibility of the revised BIP8 proposal makes it possible to
express some other ideas in terms of what they would look like using
BIP8. This provides a common factor to use for categorizing many
different proposals.

===== [#Proposal_overview .mw-headline]#Proposal overview#

Nomenclature: `+BIP8(lockinontimeout, timeout)+`. The
`+lockinontimeout+` parameter is a bool specifying whether the attempt
will conclude with a flag day activation (true) or a failure to activate
(false). The `+timeout+` parameter specifies how many months (m) or
years (y) until either the attempt fails or in mandatory activated.
Columns with empty stages appear when no action is specified in advance
(but any action with broad user support is still possible).

Precise time parameters are still under discussion, with some people
advocating moderately longer durations and some advocating moderately
shorter durations. The entries below are examples meant to reflect the
general idea behind a class of proposals.

====== [#Let.E2.80.99s_see_what_happens.2C_BIP8.28false.2C_3m.29 .mw-headline]#Let’s see what happens, BIP8(false, 3m)#

Proposed as a low-risk way to see if miners are willing to activate
taproot as quickly as they activated BIP65 CLTV (two months) and BIP68
consensus-enforced sequence numbers (one month).

Pros:

* *Non-committal:* if a problem is discovered with taproot before miner
activation, or there’s a lack of user support for the proposal, the
attempt can safely fail without further intervention.
* *Short duration:* if it fails unnecessarily, we’ll only have lost
three months plus deployment time.
* *Useful data:* if it works, it will add evidence to the theory that
segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers, and miners
can continue working together to upgrade the consensus protocol with
minimal fuss.

Cons:

* *Unnecessary failure risk (3 months):* if it fails for no good reason,
we’ll have wasted three months, plus its deployment time, plus the time
to choose and deploy another activation method.
* *Single-shot:* if it fails, anyone who ran the 3-month release must
upgrade in order to enforce any subsequent attempts. Compare to the
_start now, improve later_ proposal where early releases can be
triggered to activate by later releases.

====== [#BIP9_equivalent.2C_BIP8.28false.2C_1y.29 .mw-headline]#BIP9 equivalent, BIP8(false, 1y)#

Some people think that the lack of miner readiness signaling during the
first several months of segwit availability was an aberration specific
to the political context of the block size debate, segwit’s interference
with covert ASICBoost, or some other factor. These people may wish to
try BIP9 again. BIP8(false, 1y) is essentially BIP9 but using block
heights rather than median time past to guarantee a specified number of
signaling periods.

Pros:

* *Non-committal:* if a problem is discovered with taproot before miner
activation, or there’s a lack of user support for the proposal, the
attempt can safely fail without further intervention.
* *Useful data:* if it works, it will add evidence to the theory that
segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers, and miners
can continue working together to upgrade the consensus protocol with
minimal fuss.

Cons:

* *Unnecessary failure risk (1 year):* if it fails for no good reason,
we’ll have wasted an entire year, plus its deployment time, plus the
time to choose and deploy another activation method.

====== [#Modern_Soft_Fork_Activation.2C_BIP8.28false.2C_1y.29.2Bquiet.286m.29.2BBIP8.28true.2C_2y.29 .mw-headline]#Modern Soft Fork Activation, BIP8(false, 1y)+quiet(6m)+BIP8(true, 2y)#

Proposed in a
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-January/017547.html[mailing
list post], the goals of this idea are to ensure users truly want a soft
fork and that it’s activated in a way that minimizes the risk of
disruption.

Pros:

* *Non-committal (initial deployment):* if a problem is discovered with
taproot during the first two stages, or there’s a lack of user support
for the proposal, the attempt can safely fail without further
intervention.
* *Useful data:* if it activates quickly, it will add evidence to the
theory that segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers,
and miners can continue working together to upgrade the consensus
protocol with minimal fuss.
* *Far-off flag day:* if mandatory activation is needed, there’s a long
time (2 years) for users to upgrade to mandatory enforcement nodes. This
minimizes the chance that only a small number of users will enact
mandatory enforcement and then be tricked into accepting bitcoins that
most other users won’t consider valid.

Cons:

* *Committal (subsequent deployment):* if a problem is discovered with
taproot during the final stage, users and developers may need to
intervene to prevent the problem from being exploited.
* *Unnecessary delay:* without miner cooperation, it will take almost
three years to get the taproot features, which may delay other useful
Bitcoin work or cause developers to spend time implementing unnecessary
intermediate solutions (e.g. 2pECDSA rather than MuSig).

====== [#Decreasing_Threshold_Soft-Fork_Activation.2C_BIP8.28false.2C_6m.29.2BNoAction.281y.29.2BBIP8.28true.2C_2.5y.29 .mw-headline]#Decreasing Threshold Soft-Fork Activation, BIP8(false, 6m)+NoAction(1y)+BIP8(true, 2.5y)#

A [slight variation][bip-dectresh] on the Modern Soft Fork Activation
method, the final period in this proposal steadily decreases the
percentage of hashrate that needs to signal readiness for the soft fork
before it activates. For example, normally 95% of blocks in a difficulty
period need to signal for a BIP8 soft fork in order to activate it;
however, near the end of the final signaling period, it might only
require 60% of hash rate to signal readiness. This lower threshold is
reasonable because it’s expected that most users will be ready to
enforce the proposal at that time. Even if miners still aren’t signaling
in sufficient numbers, the proposal can mandatory activate at the end of
its final stage.

Pros:

* *Non-committal (initial deployment):* if a problem is discovered with
taproot during the first two stages, the attempt can safely fail without
further intervention.
* *Useful data:* if it activates quickly, it will add evidence to the
theory that segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers,
and miners can continue working together to upgrade the consensus
protocol with minimal fuss.
* *Far-off flag day:* if mandatory activation is needed, there’s a long
time (months or years) for users to upgrade to nodes that accept reduced
threshold signaling or mandatory activation. This minimizes the chance
that only a small number of users will enact mandatory enforcement and
then be tricked into accepting bitcoins that most other users won’t
consider valid.

Cons:

* *Committal (subsequent deployment):* if a problem is discovered with
taproot during the final stage, users and developers may need to
intervene to prevent the problem from being exploited.
* *Unnecessary delay:* without miner cooperation, it will take almost
four years to get the taproot features, which may delay other useful
Bitcoin work or cause developers to spend time implementing unnecessary
intermediate solutions (e.g. 2pECDSA rather than MuSig).
* *No reference implementation:* no implementation of this proposal yet
exists, although it is not believed that creating one would be
particularly difficult.

====== [#Start_now.2C_improve_later.2C_BIP8.28false.2C_2y.29 .mw-headline]#Start now, improve later, BIP8(false, 2y)#

Proposed as an option that maximizes flexibility, this allows miners to
signal readiness to enforce taproot quickly but also makes it easy for
users to force taproot activation later. For example, after several
months of miners not activating taproot for no good reason, an updated
node could be published that used the same BIP8 parameters except
`+lockinontimeout=true+`, requiring activation at the end of the two
years. Or `+true+` could be set and the timeout deadline could be
shortened, allowing activation within 6 or 12 more months.

Pros:

* *Non-committal:* if a problem is discovered with taproot before miner
activation, or there’s a lack of user support for the proposal, the
attempt can safely fail without further intervention.
* *Useful data:* if it activates quickly, it will add evidence to the
theory that segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers,
and miners can continue working together to upgrade the consensus
protocol with minimal fuss.
* *Enough time for second deployment:* the two year duration probably
gives users and developers enough time to deploy an alternative that
sets `+lockintimeout=true+`, allowing all nodes compatible with either
deployment to activate simultaneously.

Cons:

* *Unnecessary failure risk (2 years):* if it fails for no good reason,
we’ll have wasted two years, plus its deployment time, plus the time to
choose and deploy another activation method.
* *Chaos risk:* if some users later decide to `+lockinontimeout=true+`
with a date before the original two-year end, they all need to choose
the same date or users choosing a date with insufficient support could
be tricked into accepting non-spendable bitcoins. It may be possible to
mitigate this by building support for an acceleration target date even
before the initial `+lockinontimeout=false+` version is released.

====== [#Gently_discourage_apathy.2C_BIP8.28true.2C_2y.29 .mw-headline]#Gently discourage apathy, BIP8(true, 2y)#

Proposed as a way to ensure miners eventually need to signal, so they
don’t defer doing so out of apathy, this method requires activation
after a long delay.

Pros:

* *Useful data:* if it activates quickly, it will add evidence to the
theory that segwit activation was an aberration and users, developers,
and miners can continue working together to upgrade the consensus
protocol with minimal fuss.
* *Far-off flag day:* if mandatory activation is needed, there’s a long
time (months or years) for users to upgrade to nodes that accept reduced
threshold signaling or mandatory activation. This minimizes the chance
that only a small number of users will enact mandatory enforcement and
then be tricked into accepting bitcoins that most other users won’t
consider valid.
* *Enough time for second deployment:* the two year duration may gives
users and developers enough time to deploy additional soft fork rules
that fix any problems in the initial proposal.

Cons:

* *Committal:* if a problem is discovered with taproot before
activation, users and developers may need to intervene to prevent the
problem from being exploited.
* *Unnecessary delay:* without miner cooperation, it will take two years
to get the taproot features, which may delay other useful Bitcoin work
or cause developers to spend time implementing unnecessary intermediate
solutions (e.g. 2pECDSA rather than MuSig).
* *Chaos risk:* if some users later decide to `+lockinontimeout=true+`
with a date before the original two-year end, they all need to choose
the same date or users choosing a date with insufficient support could
be tricked into accepting non-spendable bitcoins. It may be possible to
mitigate this by building support for an acceleration target date even
before the initial version is released.
