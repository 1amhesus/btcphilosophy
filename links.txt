"Every piece of additional consensus logic has implementation and
ongoing maintenance cost which is perpetual and can never be removed
without potentially confiscating some user's assets."

Greg Maxwell on decentralization
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/
"A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won't
understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization
properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the
first place. ... a risk we can see playing out constantly in the
billion dollar market caps of totally centralized systems. The ability
demonstrated by system with fake decentralization to arbitrarily
change the rules out from under users is far more concerning than the
risk that an expensive attack could allow some theft in the case of
over-eagerly finalized transactions."

Matt Corallo on trustlessness
Trust models. You can build trusted systems on top of trustless systems, but not the other way around.
If users expect the system to not change, they will preserve the rules. This separates Bitcoin from most other coins.
Don't force your preferred trust model upon others.

Limited money supply [trust, consensus rules]

"So the answer is that you don't have to trust someone to not increase the supply. You just have to run some code that will verify that they haven't."
