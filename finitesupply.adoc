== Finite supply

Is it set in stone that Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million
BTC? No. First of all, the famous number 21 million is only
approximate. Pieter Wuille clears things up regarding the exact amount

Due to a number of reasons -- such as early problems with coinbase
transactions, miners that unintentionally claim less than allowed, and
loss of private keys -- the upper limit of 21m will never be reached.

What's more important than the exact number is how the consensus rule
of limited supply is enforced without a central authority. Alias
chytrik puts it well on
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/106830/69518[Stack Exchange].

So the answer is that you don't have to trust someone to not increase
the supply. You just have to run some code that will verify that they
haven't.
____

Even if some full nodes give themselves to the dark side and decide to
accept blocks with larger coinbase transactions, all other full nodes
will simply neglect them and continue as usual.

//And even though no robot is doing anything perfectly, the rules are
//such that we can get the collective to do its goal robustly
//together.

Full nodes may intentionally or unintentionally run bad software, yet
the collective robustly secures the blockchain together. Thus you can
trust the system without having to trust anyone.

=== Block subsidy and transaction fees

It is the block subsidy together with transaction fees that together
need to cover Bitcoin's security costs. We can say for sure that with
today's block subsidy, transaction fees, bitcoin price, mempool size,
hash power, degree of decentralization, etc, etc, the incentives to
play by the rules are high enough to preserve a secure monetary
system.

But what the future holds for us, we cannot know. The uncertainty
factors are numerous and we are left to speculations. For example Paul
Sztorc's contribution to the subject
https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/[in his Truthcoin
blog] is mostly speculations, but he has at least one good solid
point:

[quote, Paul Sztorc, Truthcoin]

While the two are mixed into the same “security budget”, the block
subsidy and txn-fees are utterly and completely different. They are as
different from each other, as “VISA’s total profits in 2017” are from
the “total increase in M2 in 2017”.
____

Here, M2 is a measurement of a fiat money supply. 

Today, hodlers pay for security (via monetary inflation). Tomorrow
it's the spenders that somehow need to shoulder this burden, as
illustrated below.

.As time goes by, the bearing of security costs will shift from hodlers to spenders.

So, given that the consensus on finite supply remains, the block
subsidy will, thanks to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki[BIP42
;)], be zero from around year 2140. Will the transaction fees after
that be enough to secure the network? It's impossible to say, but we
do know some things:

* A century is a _long_ time from the Bitcoin perspective. If it is
  still around, it has probably evolved enormously.
* With zero block subsidy and an empty or almost empty mempool, things
  will be shaky. For example, fee
  https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57149/how-do-transaction-fees-exacerbate-instability-in-bitcoin-in-the-future[sniping
  might become more profitable than regular mining]
* If an overwhelming economic majority finds it attractive to change
  the rules and introduce for example a perpetual annual 0.1% or 1%
  monetary inflation, to ensure that the chain keeps marching forward,
  the supply of bitcoin will no longer be finite.

=== Security despite uncertainty 

If nothing is set in stone and future is so uncertain, how can we
trust this system to keep our savings safe?

Well, security without centralized trust is new to us humans and we
need time to grasp the novel mindset. Just because consensus rules
_can_ change does not mean that they will. Perhaps we could think of
Bitcoin as something organic. Imagine a small slowly growing oak
plant. And that you had never seen a full grown tree in you
life. Would it not be wise then, to restrain your control issues and
not set all rules in advance on how this plant should be allowed to
evolve and grow? Below are two articles showing how the bitcoin system
is secured, despite all uncertainties.

Jameson Lopp emphasizes in
https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/[his blog]
how important it is to run your own full node and explains why. He
also says that even if mining isn't as decentralized as one would
like, miners are, due to their large capital investments, highly
incentivized to play by the rules.

[quote, James Lopp, Cypherpunk Cogitations]
____
It’s clear that running your own full node offers superior security
with the fewest required assumptions. Given that you can build a
computer capable of running a reliable full node for only a few
hundred dollars, do the math and determine if securing your financial
sovereignty is worth the price.
____

Finally, there are some nice onion pictures in
https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/the-onion-model-of-blockchain-security-part-1/[Hasu's
article at Insights] worth mentioning. The illustrations pedagogically
present the different security layers, but the text is written in a
general crypto point of view and is sometimes difficult to follow.

=== Conclusion

Whether the bitcoin supply will grow above 21 million we cannot say
today and that is probably not so bad. Ensuring that the security
budget remains high enough is crucial but not urgent. Let's have this
discussion in 10-50 years when we know more. If it's still relevant.
