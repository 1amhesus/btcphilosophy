== Finite supply

The well known finite supply of 21 million BTC is regarded as a
fundamental property in Bitcoin. But is it really set in stone?

Let's start by looking at what the current consensus rules say about
the money supply of Bitcoin, and how much of that will actually be
usable. Pieter Wuille wrote a piece about this
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/38998/69518[on Stack Exchange],
where he counted how many bitcoins there would be once all coins are
mined:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange]
____
If you sum all these numbers together, you get *20999999.9769* BTC.
____

But due to a number of reasons -- such as early problems with coinbase
transactions, miners that unintentionally claim less than allowed, and
loss of private keys -- that upper limit will never be reached. Wuille
concludes:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange]
____
This leaves us with *20999817.31308491* BTC (taking everything up to
block 528333 into account)

\... However, various wallets have been lost or stolen, transactions
have been sent to the wrong address, people forgot they owned
bitcoin. The totals of this may well be millions. People have tried to
tally known losses up
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7253.0[here].

This leaves us with: *???* BTC.
____

We can thus be sure that the money supply is at most
20999817.31308491 BTC. Any lost or unverifiably burnt coins will make
this number lower, but we don't know how much lower. The interesting
thing is that it doesn't really matter, or it does matter in a
positive way for bitcoin holders,
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=198.msg1647#msg1647[as
explained] by Satoshi Nakamoto:

[quote,Satoshi Nakamoto on lost bitcoins, Bitcointalk forum]
____
Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think
of it as a donation to everyone.
____

The finite supply will shrink which, at least in theory, should cause
price deflation.

What's more important than the exact number of coins in circulation is
how the consensus rule of limited supply is enforced without a central
authority. Alias chytrik puts it well on
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/106830/69518[Stack Exchange].

____
So the answer is that you don't have to trust someone to not increase
the supply. You just have to run some code that will verify that they
haven't.
____

Even if some full nodes give themselves to the dark side and decide to
accept blocks with larger coinbase transactions, all other full nodes
will simply neglect them and continue as usual. Full nodes may
intentionally or unintentionally (see the
<<combined-output-overflow,When shit hits the fan>> chapter) run bad
software, yet the collective robustly secures the blockchain
together. Thus you can choose to trust the system without having to
trust anyone.

=== Block subsidy and transaction fees

A block reward is composed of a block subsidy and transactions
fees. The block reward needs to cover Bitcoin's security costs. We can
say for sure that with today's block subsidy, transaction fees,
bitcoin price, mempool size, hash power, degree of decentralization,
etc, the incentives to play by the rules are high enough to preserve a
secure monetary system.

What happens when the block subsidy is zero, or very close to zero
(but for simplicity assume zero)? At that point, the system's security
budget will be paid for only through transaction fees. What the future
holds for us when this happens, we cannot know. The uncertainty
factors are numerous and we are left to speculations. For example Paul
Sztorc's contribution to the subject
https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/[in his Truthcoin
blog] is mostly speculations, but he has at least one solid point (M2,
as Sztorc refers to, is a measurement of a fiat money supply):

[quote, 'Paul Sztorc, Security Budget in the Long Run', Truthcoin blog]
____
While the two are mixed into the same “security budget”, the block
subsidy and txn-fees are utterly and completely different. They are as
different from each other, as “VISA’s total profits in 2017” are from
the “total increase in M2 in 2017”.
____

Today, holders pay for security (via monetary inflation). Tomorrow
it's the spenders that somehow need to shoulder this burden, as
illustrated below.

.As time goes by, the bearing of security costs will shift from holders to spenders.

When transaction fees are the main motivation for mining, the
incentives shift. For example, if the mempool of a miner doesn't
contain enough transaction fees, it might become more profitable for
that miner to rewrite Bitcoin's history rather than to
extend it. Bitcoin Optech has an explainer on this behavior, called
_fee sniping_, written by David Harding:

[quote,"David Harding, fee sniping", Bitcoin Optech website]
____
Fee sniping is a problem that may occur as Bitcoin’s subsidy continues
to diminish and transaction fees begin to dominate Bitcoin’s block
rewards. If transaction fees are all that matter, then a miner with
`x` percent of the hash rate has a `x` percent chance of mining the
next block, so the expected value to them of honestly mining is `x`
percent of the
https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/06/02/#candidate-set-based-csb-block-template-construction[best
feerate set of transactions] in their mempool.

Alternatively, a miner could dishonestly attempt to re-mine the
previous block plus a wholly new block to extend the chain. This
behavior is referred to as fee sniping, and the dishonest miner’s
chance of succeeding at it if every other miner is honest is
`(x/(1-x))^2`. Even though fee sniping has an overall lower probability
of success than honest mining, attempting dishonest mining could be
the more profitable choice if transactions in the previous block paid
significantly higher feerates than the transactions currently in the
mempool—a small chance at a large amount can be worth more than a
large chance at a small amount.
____

To further put a wet blanket over our hopes for the future, if miners
conduct fee sniping, it further incentivizes others to do the same,
leaving even fewer honest miners. This could severely impair the
overall security of Bitcoin. Harding goes on to list a few
countermeasures that have been taken, for example using transaction
lock time to restrict where in the blockchain the transaction may
appear.

So, given that the consensus on finite supply remains, the block
subsidy will, thanks to
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki[BIP42
;)], be zero from around year 2140. Will the transaction fees after
that be enough to secure the network? It's impossible to say, but we
do know some things:

* A century is a _long_ time from the Bitcoin perspective. If it is
  still around, it has probably evolved enormously.
* If an overwhelming economic majority finds it attractive to change
  the rules and introduce for example a perpetual annual 0.1% or 1%
  monetary inflation, to ensure that the chain keeps marching forward,
  the supply of bitcoin will no longer be finite.
* With zero block subsidy and an empty or almost empty mempool, things
  can become shaky due to fee sniping.

Since the transition to a fee-only economy is so far in the future, it
might be wise to not jump to conclusions and try to fix the potential
issues. For example, Peter Todd thinks there's a risk that Bitcoin's
security budget won't be enough in the future and argued for a small
perpetual inflation in Bitcoin. However, he also thinks it's not a
good idea to discuss that at this time, and on the
https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/peter-todd-on-the-essence-of-bitcoin[What
Bitcoin Did podcast he said]:

[quote,Peter Todd on security budget, What Bitcoin Did podcast]
____
But, that’s a risk like 10, 20 years in the future. That is a very
long time. And, by then, who the hell knows what the risks are?
____

Perhaps we could think of Bitcoin as something organic. Imagine a
small slowly growing oak plant. And that you had never seen a full
grown tree in your life. Would it not be wise then, to restrain your
control issues and not set all rules in advance on how this plant
should be allowed to evolve and grow?

=== Conclusion

Whether the bitcoin supply will grow above 21 million we cannot say
today and that is probably not so bad. Ensuring that the security
budget remains high enough is crucial but not urgent. Let's have this
discussion in 10-50 years when we know more. If it's still relevant.

=== What is Bitcoin?

Suppose that the supply schedule of Bitcoin would change through a
mostly successful hard fork (which is unlikely), what would that do to
peoples perception of Bitcoin?

What Bitcoin is is an emergent property of Bitcoin. Remember Bitcoin
consists not only of software, but also humans. Different people will
have different views on what Bitcoin is, just as they have different
views on what the English language is. Still, English works pretty
well.



How is the supply curve kept? How can
you trust that?

Is bitcoin still bitcoin if 21M lifted? Any other hard fork?

Conclusion


Comments from Jonas:

* Chapter could be bigger
* Developer's relationship with the community, regarding who change
  the rules.
* Meta idea of the reliability/soundness of the protocol. Money
  shouldn't change on you and you shouldn't be coerced to
  upgrade. Bitcoin isn't about moving fast and breaking things (see
  adversarial thinking section).
* Is Bitcoin still Bitcoin if 21M is lifted? Or any other
  non-emergency hard-fork.?
* Fungi
