== Finite Supply

Is it set in stone that Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million BTC? No. 

First of all, the famous number 21 million is only approximately correct. Pieter Wuille clears tings out regarding the exact amount: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/38998/69518[on Stack Exchange].

Alias https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/106830/69518[chytrik on Stack Exchange] explains how the consensus rule of limited supply is enforced:

So the answer is that you don't have to trust someone to not increase the supply. You just have to run some code that will verify that they haven't.

Thus you can trust the system without having to trust anyone.

=== Block Subsidy and Transaction Fees
We can say fore sure that the above cited statement holds right now, with today's block subsidy, transaction fees, bitcoin price, mempool size, hash power, degree of decentralization, etc, etc.  

But what the future holds for us on this subject, we cannot know. The uncertainty factors are numerous and we are left to speculations. For example Paul Sztorc contribution to the subject (https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/)[in the Truthcoin blog]  is mostly speculations, but he has at least one good solid point:

While the two are mixed into the same “security budget”, the block subsidy and txn-fees are utterly and completely different. They are as different from each other, as “VISA’s total profits in 2017” are from the “total increase in M2 in 2017”.

Today, hodlers pay for security (via monetary inflation). Tomorrow it's the spenders that somehow need to shoulder this burden. See diagram below.

Given that the consensus on finite supply remains, the block subsidy will, thanks to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0042.mediawiki[BIP42 ;)], be zero from year 2140. Will the transaction fees after that be enough to secure the network? It's impossible to say, but we do know some things:

* A century is a _long_ time from the Bitcoin perspective. If it is still around, it has probably evolved enormously.
* With zero block subsidy and an empty or almost empty mempool, things will be shaky. For example, fee sniping might become more profitable than regular mining https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57149/how-do-transaction-fees-exacerbate-instability-in-bitcoin-in-the-future
* If an overwhelming economic majority finds it attractive to change the rules and introduce for example a perpetual annual 0.1% or 1% monetary inflation, to ensure that the chain keeps marching forward, the supply of bitcoin will no longer be finite.

=== Security Despite Uncertainty 
If nothing is set in stone and future is so uncertain, how can we trust this system to keep our savings safe?

Well, security without centralized trust is new to us humans and we need time to grasp this new mind set. Just because consensus rules _can_ change does not mean that they will. Perhaps we could think of Bitcoin as something organic. Imagine a small slowly growing oak plant. And that you had never seen a full grown tree in you life. Would it not be wise then, to restrain your control issues and not set all rules in advance on how this plant should be allowed to evolve and grow? Below are two articles showing how the bitcoin system is secured, despite all uncertainties.

* Jameson Lopp https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/11/13/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/[on Coin Desk] emphasizes how important it is to run your own full node and also explains why. And even if mining is not as decentralized as one would like, they are, due to there large capital investments, highly incentivized to play by the rules.

* There are some nice onion pictures in https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/the-onion-model-of-blockchain-security-part-1/[Hasu's article at Insights] that pedagogically illustrate different security layers. But the text is written in a general crypto point of view and is sometimes difficult to follow.

=== Conclusion
Weather the bitcoin supply will grow above 21 million we cannot say today and that is probably not so bad. Ensuring that the security budget remains high enough is crucial but not urgent. Let's have this discussion in 10-50 years when we know more. If it's still relevant.
