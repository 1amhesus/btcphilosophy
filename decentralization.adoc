== Decentralization

A system without a central point of control is often referred to as
_decentralized_. Bitcoin is decentralized but it might be good to
ponder why it's made that way and what challenges lies
therein.

=== Miner decentralization

Bitcoin is made decentralized to avoid having a central point of
control, or more specifically, a _central point of censorship_. If the
system was censorable, it would most likely, based on historic events,
be co-opted by governments in order to apply pressure on users, for
example to require identification or that they declare where their
money is coming from, before their transactions are allowed to enter
the blockchain.

The censor could also change the rules of the system arbitrarily, for
example increase the money supply in order to enrich themselves. Users
are left with three options:

* Accept the changes and adopt them into their verifying software.
* Reject the changes, leaving them with a system that doesn't process
transactions anymore.
* Appoint a new central point of control, after which the same issues
  will most likely resurface sooner or later. Also this election would
  in itself probably have to be somewhat centrally controlled or
  censored.

None of these options are beneficial to the end user. Censorship
resistance through decentralization is what separates Bitcoin from
other money systems, but it's not an easy thing to accomplish, due to
the _double spending problem_. This is the problem of making sure no
one can spend the same coin twice, a problem that many thought was
impossible to solve in a decentralized fashion. Satoshi Nakamoto
writes in his https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin paper] about how
to solve the double spending problem:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, The Bitcoin paper]
____
In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem
using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate
computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
____

He uses the weird sounding phrase _peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
server_, but the key here is the word _distributed_, which in this
context means that there is no central point of control. Nakamoto then
goes on to explain how proof-of-work is the solution, but no one
explains it better than
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/[Gregory
Maxwell on Reddit] where he responds to someone who proposes to limit
miners' hashpower to avoid 51% attacks:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
A decentralized system like Bitcoin uses a public election. But you
can't just have a vote of 'people' in a decentralized system because
that would require a centralized party to authorize people to
vote. Instead, Bitcoin uses a vote of computing power because it's
possible to verify computing power without the help of any centralized
third party.
____

The post explains how the decentralized Bitcoin network can come to
agreement on a transaction ordering through the use of proof-of-work,
then he concludes by saying that the 51% attack is not particularly
worrisome, compared to people not caring about, or lack of
understanding about Bitcoin's decentralization properties.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won't
understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization
properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the
first place.
____

The conclusion is an important one. If people don't protect Bitcoin's
decentralization, which is a proxy for censorship resistance, Bitcoin
might fall victim for centralizing powers until it's so centralized
that censoship becomes a thing. Then most, if not all, of its value
proposition is gone. This brings us to the next section, on Full node
decentralization.

=== Full node decentralization

We've mostly talked about miner dentralization above, and how miner
centralization can allow for censorship. But there's also another
aspect of decentralization, which is full node decentralization.

The importance of full node decentralization is related to
<<trustlessness, trustlessness>>. If a user stops running his/her own
full node due to prohibitively increased cost of operation, they have
to interact with the Bitcoin network in some other way, for example
web wallets, or lightweight wallets, which require more or less
trust. Aaron Van Wirdum of Bitcoin Magazine writes in
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralist-perspective-bitcoin-might-need-small-blocks-1442090446[his
article about decentralization]:

[quote, Aaron Van Wirdum, Bitcoin Magazine]
____
An obvious consequence would be that it injects trust in the
system. Instead of using trustless full nodes, users would, for
instance, use web-wallets â€“ which obviously require a lot of trust in
the service. But even solutions such as Simplified Payments
Verification (SPV) nodes are no better in this regard, as they do not
verify the consensus rules either.
____

In the article, Van Wirdum interviews some Bitcoin developers about
their views on decentralization and the risks involved in increasing
Bitcoin's maximum block size. This topic was very hot during the
period 2014-2017, when many people argued for and against increasing
the block size limit to allow for more transaction throughput.

A very strong argument against increasing the block size is that it
increases the cost of verification. If verification cost increases, it
will push some full node users to stop running their full nodes. This
in turn leads to more people not being able to use the system in a
trustless way. Pieter Wuille is quoted in the article, where he
explains the risks in full node decentralization.

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Magazine]
____
If lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be
convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the
decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules
their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance
because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or
mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities
can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything
that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.
____

There you go. It's important that Bitcoin users run their own full
nodes to deter regulators and big corporations from trying to change
the consensus rules.

=== Grokking decentralization

An interesting aspect of decentralization is the hard to grasp fact
that no one controls it. There are no committees or exectutives in
Bitcoin. Gregory Maxwell, again
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/s82t2n/comment/htdte7w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[on
the Bitcoin subreddit], compares this to the English languate in an
interesting way:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
Many people have a hard time understanding autonomous systems, there
are many in their lives things like the english language-- but people
just take them for granted and don't even think of them as
systems. They're stuck in a centralized way of thinking where
everything they think of as a 'thing' has an authority that
controls it.

Bitcoin doesn't focus on anything. Various people who have adopted
Bitcoin chose of their own free will to promote it, and how they
choose to do so is their own business. Authority fixated people may
see these activities and believe they're some operation by the bitcoin
authority, but no such authority exists.
____

No matter what you think about Bitcoin, its decentralized nature makes
it very hard to control. Bitcoin exists and there's nothing you can do
about it. It's a thing to be studied, not debated.
