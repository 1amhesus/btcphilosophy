== Decentralization

Bitcoin has been designed to avoid a central point of control, or more
specifically, a _central point of censorship_. A system without a central point
of control is often referred to as _decentralized_.

=== Miner decentralization

If Bitcoin were centralized and therefore censorable, it would be vulnerable to
those who wish to censor, such as governments.

The censor would apply pressure on users. They could require identification or
that users declare where their money is coming from before their transactions
are allowed to enter the blockchain.

The censor could also try to change the system's rules, for
example, inflate the money supply to enrich themselves. In such an event,
A user verifying blocks has three options for how to handle
the changed rules:

* Adopt: Accept the changes and adopt them into its full node.
* Reject: This leaves the user with a system that doesn't process
transactions anymore, because the censor's blocks are deemed invalid
by the user's full node.
* Move: Appoint a new central point of control. The users have to
  coordinate this somehow so that they agree on what new central point
  of control to use. If they succeed, the same issues will most likely
  resurface sooner or later, because the system is as censorable now
  as it was before.

None of these options are beneficial to the user. Censorship
resistance through decentralization is what separates Bitcoin from
other money systems, but it's not an easy thing to accomplish, due to
the _double spending problem_. This is the problem of making sure no
one can spend the same coin twice, a problem that many thought was
impossible to solve in a decentralized fashion. Satoshi Nakamoto
writes in his https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin paper] about how
to solve the double spending problem:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, The Bitcoin paper]
____
In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem
using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate
computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.
____

He uses the weird sounding phrase _peer-to-peer distributed timestamp
server_, but the key here is the word _distributed_, which in this
context means that there is no central point of control. Nakamoto then
goes on to explain how proof-of-work is the solution, but no one
explains it better than
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/[Gregory
Maxwell on Reddit] where he responds to someone who proposes to limit
miners' hashpower to avoid 51% attacks:

[[one-cpu-one-vote]]
[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
A decentralized system like Bitcoin uses a public election. But you
can't just have a vote of 'people' in a decentralized system because
that would require a centralized party to authorize people to
vote. Instead, Bitcoin uses a vote of computing power because it's
possible to verify computing power without the help of any centralized
third party.
____

The post explains how the decentralized Bitcoin network can come to
agreement on a transaction ordering through the use of proof-of-work,
then he concludes by saying that the 51% attack is not particularly
worrisome, compared to people not caring about, or lack of
understanding about Bitcoin's decentralization properties.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won't
understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization
properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the
first place.
____

The conclusion is an important one. If people don't protect Bitcoin's
decentralization, which is a proxy for censorship resistance, Bitcoin
might fall victim to centralizing powers until it's so centralized
that censorship becomes a thing. Then most, if not all, of its value
proposition is gone. This brings us to the next section, on full node
decentralization.

=== Full node decentralization

We've mostly talked about miner decentralization above, and how miner
centralization can allow for censorship. But there's also another
aspect of decentralization, which is full node decentralization.

The importance of full node decentralization is related to
<<trustlessness,trustlessness>>. If a user stops running his/her own
full node, for example due to prohibitively increased cost of
operation, they have to interact with the Bitcoin network in some
other way, for example web wallets, or lightweight wallets, which
require more or less trust. Aaron Van Wirdum of Bitcoin Magazine
writes in
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralist-perspective-bitcoin-might-need-small-blocks-1442090446[his
Bitcoin Magazine article] about decentralization:

[quote, Aaron Van Wirdum, Bitcoin Magazine]
____
An obvious consequence would be that it injects trust in the
system. Instead of using trustless full nodes, users would, for
instance, use web-wallets – which obviously require a lot of trust in
the service. But even solutions such as Simplified Payments
Verification (SPV) nodes are no better in this regard, as they do not
verify the consensus rules either.
____

In the article, Van Wirdum interviews some Bitcoin developers about
their views on decentralization and the risks involved in increasing
Bitcoin's maximum block size. This topic was very hot during the
period 2014-2017, when many people argued for and against increasing
the block size limit to allow for more transaction throughput.

A very strong argument against increasing the block size is that it
increases the cost of verification. If verification cost increases, it
will push some full node users to stop running their full nodes. This
in turn leads to more people not being able to use the system in a
trustless way. Pieter Wuille is quoted in the article, where he
explains the risks in full node centralization.

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin Magazine]
____
If lots companies run a full node, it means they all need to be
convinced to implement a different rule set. In other words: the
decentralization of block validation is what gives consensus rules
their weight. But if full node count would drop very low, for instance
because everyone uses the same web-wallets, exchanges and SPV or
mobile wallets, regulation could become a reality. And if authorities
can regulate the consensus rules, it means they can change anything
that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Even the 21 million bitcoin limit.
____

There you go. It's important that Bitcoin users run their own full
nodes to deter regulators and big corporations from trying to change
the consensus rules.

=== Neutrality

Bitcoin is neutral, or permissionless as people like to call it. This
means that Bitcoin doesn't care who you are or what you use
Bitcoin for.

[quote, wumpus on freenode IRC (punctuation added), #bitcoin-core-dev 2012-04-04T17:34:04 UTC]
____
bitcoin is neutral, which is a good thing, and the only way it can
work. if it was controlled by an organisation it'd just be another
virtual object type and I would have zero interest in it
____

As long as you play by the rules, you're free to use it
as you please, without asking anyone for permission. This includes
_mining_, _transacting_ in, and _building protocols and services_ on top of
Bitcoin.

////
In the foreword of [Grokking Bitcoin], David Harding writes about
Bitcoin's neutrality and how it differs from regular systems:

[quote, David Harding, Foreword of Grokking Bitcoin
____
"A decentralized system that doesn’t use identities or depend on trust
is quite different from the everyday systems with which most of us are
familiar."
____
////

* If *mining* would have been a permissioned process, you'd need a
central authority to select who's allowed to mine. This would most
likely lead to miners having to sign legal contracts where they agree
to censor transactions according to the whims of the central
authority, which defeats the purpose of mining in the first place.

* If people *transacting* in Bitcoin would have to provide personal
information, what their transactions are used for, or otherwise prove
that they are worthy of transacting, we would also need a central
point of authority to give permission to users or transactions. Again,
this would lead to censorship and exclusion.

* If developers had to ask for permission to *build protocols* on top of
Bitcoin, only protocols that the central developer granting commitee
allows would be developed. This would, due to government intervention,
inevitably exclude all privacy preserving protocols and all attempts
at improving decentralization.

At all levels, trying to impose restrictions on who gets to use
Bitcoin for what will hurt Bitcoin to the point where it's no longer
living up to its value proposition.

Pieter Wuille https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/92055/69518[answers
a question on Stack Exchange] about how the blockchain relates to
normal databases. He explains how permissionlessness is achievable
through use of proof-of-work in combination with economic
incentives. He concludes:

[quote, Pieter Wuille, Stack Exchange]
____
Using trustless consensus algorithms like PoW does add something no
other construction gives you (permissionless participation, meaning
there is no set group of participants that can censor your changes),
but comes at a high cost, and its economic assumptions make it pretty
much only useful for systems that define their own
cryptocurrency. There is probably only place in the world for one or a
few actually used ones of these.
____

He describes that to achieve premissionlessness, the system [most
likely] needs its own currency.

fault-tolerant systems assume that a strict majority or supermajority
(e.g., more than half or two-thirds) of nodes in the system are both
honest and reliable. In an open peer-to-peer network, there is no
registration of nodes, and they freely join and leave. Thus an
adversary can create enough Sybils, or sockpuppet nodes, to overcome
the consensus guarantees of the system. The Sybil attack was
formalized in 2002 by John Douceur,14 who turned to a cryptographic
construction called proof of work to mitigate it."

Burn your hand is a good lesson, can't intellectually learn that.


Users - Anyone interacting through the Bitcoin protocol. Miners, hodlers, merchants, etc.

Bitcoin can be used on any level without asking anyone for permission.

Why is this important?


* If mining becomes too centralized, users can opt to start mining

* If Bitcoin wasn't permissionless, some authority would be needed to
  decide who's allowed to participate and who's not. This would be a
  centralized system and Bitcoin would fall under censorship pressure.

=== Grokking decentralization

An interesting aspect of Bitcoin is how hard it is to grasp the fact
that no one controls it. There are no committees or executives in
Bitcoin. Gregory Maxwell, again
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/s82t2n/comment/htdte7w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[on
the Bitcoin subreddit], compares this to the English language in an
interesting way:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, r/Bitcoin subreddit]
____
Many people have a hard time understanding autonomous systems, there
are many in their lives things like the english language-- but people
just take them for granted and don't even think of them as
systems. They're stuck in a centralized way of thinking where
everything they think of as a 'thing' has an authority that
controls it.

Bitcoin doesn't focus on anything. Various people who have adopted
Bitcoin chose of their own free will to promote it, and how they
choose to do so is their own business. Authority fixated people may
see these activities and believe they're some operation by the bitcoin
authority, but no such authority exists.
____

.Fish schools have no leaders.

The way Bitcoin works through decentralization resembles the
extraordinary collective intelligence found among many species in
nature. Computer scientist Radhika Nagpal speaks in a
https://www.ted.com/talks/radhika_nagpal_what_intelligent_machines_can_learn_from_a_school_of_fish[Ted
talk] about the collective behavior of fish schools, and how they try
to mimic that using robots.

[quote, Radhika Nagpal, What intelligent machines can learn from a school of fish]
____
Secondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable, is that we
know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school. Instead,
this incredible collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the
interactions of one fish and another. Somehow, there are these
interactions or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make
it all work out.
____

She points out that many systems, in nature or man-made, can and do
work without leaders, and they are very powerful and resilient. Each
individual just interacts with its immediate surroundings, but
together they form something tremendous.

No matter what you think about Bitcoin, its decentralized nature makes
it very hard to control. Bitcoin exists and there's nothing you can do
about it. It's a thing to be studied, not debated.
