== When shit hits the fan

WARNING: {wip}

Bitcoin is built by people. People creating software, let's call them
developers, and people running this software, let's call them
users.

When a security vulnerability or a severe bug is discovered (is there
really a distinction between the two?), it's always discovered by
people, flesh and blood. This chapter will contemplate what people do,
should do, and shouldn't do when shit hits the fan.

Imagine that you discover a bug in Bitcoin Core that lets anyone
remotely shut down a Bitcoin Core node using some specially crafted
network messages. Imagine also that you are not malicious and you
would like this issue to remain unexploited.

What do you do?

If you remain silent about it, someone else will probably discover
this issue in time, and you can't be sure that person isn't malicious.

[[responsible-disclosure]]
=== Responsible disclosure

When a security issue is discovered, the person discovering it should
employ _responsible disclosure_ which is a term often used among
Bitcoin developers. The term is
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure[explained
on Wikipedia]:

[quote, Wikipedia, Responsible disclosure article]
____
Developers of hardware and software often require time and resources
to repair their mistakes. Often, it is ethical hackers who find these
vulnerabilities.[1] Hackers and computer security scientists have the
opinion that it is their social responsibility to make the public
aware of vulnerabilities. Hiding problems could cause a feeling of
false security. To avoid this, the involved parties coordinate and
negotiate a reasonable period of time for repairing the
vulnerability. Depending on the potential impact of the vulnerability,
the expected time needed for an emergency fix or workaround to be
developed and applied and other factors, this period may vary between
a few days and several months.
____

What this means is that if you find a security issue, you should
report this to the team responsible for the system. But what does this
mean in the context of Bitcoin?

As noted in <<_software_maintenance, the Open source chapter>>, no one
controls Bitcoin, but there's a focal point for Bitcoin development,
currently the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin[Bitcoin Core Github
repository]. The maintainers of this repository are responsible for
the code in it, but they're not responsible for the system as a
whole-- no one is. Nevertheless, the general best practice is to send
an email to security@bitcoincore.org.

In
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/015002.html[an
email thread] titled "Responsible disclosure of bugs", Anthony Towns
tries to summarize what he perceived to be current best practice. He
had collected input from several sources and different people.

[quote, Anthony Towns in thread "Responsible disclosure of bugs",Bitcoin-dev email list]
____

* Vulnerabilities should be reported via security at bitcoincore.org
  [0]
* A critical issue (that can be exploited immediately or is already
  being exploited causing large harm) will be dealt with by:
** a released patch ASAP
** wide notification of the need to upgrade (or to disable affected
   systems)
** minimal disclosure of the actual problem, to delay attacks [1] [2]
* A non-critical vulnerability (because it is difficult or expensive
  to exploit) will be dealt with by:
** patch and review undertaken in the ordinary flow of development
** backport of a fix or workaround from master to the current released
   version [2]
* Devs will attempt to ensure that publication of the fix does not
  reveal the nature of the vulnerability by providing the proposed fix
  to experienced devs who have not been informed of the vulnerability,
  telling them that it fixes a vulnerability, and asking them to
  identify the vulnerability. [2]
* Devs may recommend other bitcoin implementations adopt vulnerability
  fixes prior to the fix being released and widely deployed, if they
  can do so without revealing the vulnerability; eg, if the fix has
  significant performance benefits that would justify its
  inclusion. [3]
* Prior to a vulnerability becoming public, devs will generally
  recommend to friendly altcoin devs that they should catch up with
  fixes. But this is only after the fixes are widely deployed in the
  bitcoin network. [4]
* Devs will generally not notify altcoin developers who have behaved
  in a hostile manner (eg, using vulnerabilities to attack others, or
  who violate embargoes). [5]
* Bitcoin devs won't disclose vulnerability details until >80% of
  bitcoin nodes have deployed the fixes. Vulnerability discovers are
  encouraged and requested to follow the same policy. [1] [6]
____

This list displays how careful one must be when publishing patches for
Bitcoin, because the patch itself might give away the
vulnerability. The fourth bullet is particularly interesting and
explains how to test if a patch is good enough disguise. If a few
really experienced developers can't spot the vulnerability, even
knowing that the patch fixes one, then it's probably hard for others
to discover it from this patch.

The thread that led up to this email were discussing if, when, and how
to disclose vulnerabilities to alt-coins and other implementations of
Bitcoin. There are no clear answers here. "Helping the good guys"
seems like a sensible thing to do, but who decides who they are and
where do you draw the line? Bryan Bishop argued that helping altcoins
and even scamcoins defend against security exploits is a moral duty.

[quote, Bryan Bishop in thread "Responsible disclosure of bugs", Bitcoin-dev email list]
____
It's not enough to defend bitcoin and its users from active threats,
there is a more general responsibility to defend all kinds of users
and different software from many kinds of threats in whatever forms,
even if folks are using stupid and insecure software that you
personally don't maintain or contribute to or advocate for. Handling
knowledge of a vulnerability is a delicate matter and you might be
receiving knowledge with more serious direct or indirect impact than
originally described.
____

Also leading up to Town's email above was a post from Gregory Maxwell,
where he argued that security vulnerabilities can be more severe than
they appear.

[quote, Gregory Maxwell in thread "Responsible disclosure of bugs", Bitcoin-dev email list]
____
I've multiple time seen a hard to exploit issue turn out to be trivial
when you find the right trick, or a minor dos issue turn our to far
more serious.

Simple performance bugs, expertly deployed, can potentially be used to
carve up the network--- miner A and exchange B go in one partition,
everyone else in another.. and doublespend.

And so on.  So while I absolutely do agree that different things
should and can be handled differently, it is not always so clear cut.
It's prudent to treat things as more severe than you know them to be.
____

So even if a vulnerability seems hard to exploit, it might be best to
assume it's easily exploited and that you just haven't figured out
how yet.

He also mentions how "it's somewhat incorrect to call this thread
anything about disclosure, this thread is not about
disclosure. Disclosure is when you tell the vendor.  This thread is
about publication and that has very different
implications. Publication is when you're sure you've told the
prospective attackers." This last observation of the disctinction
between disclosure and publication is an important one. The easy part
is responsible disclosure; the hard part is to sensibly publish.

////
Bitcoin-dev "Responsible disclosure of bugs" from 2017:

Key points:
* Core releases fixes disguised as fixes for less severe issues, or optimizations.
* Core lets experienced devs examine patches to find the actual vulnerability
* Hard to draw the line on which altcoins to inform/help patch.
** Bryan Bishop on not leaving scamcoins out of disclosures https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/014983.html
* Security vulns can be more severe than they first appear (See gregs mail)
* There is a de facto plan for vulnerabilities (See A Towns email)
* Most issues have been discovered by "insiders" due to the expertise needed https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-September/014991.html
** In Bitcoin the overwhelming majority of serious issues we've
encountered have been found by people I'd consider 'inside the
project' (frequent regular contributors who aren't seriously involved
in other things).  That hasn't been so obviously the case for other
open source projects that I've been involved with; but Bitcoin is
pretty good from a basic security perspective and finding additional
issues often requires specialized experience that few people outside
of the project regulars have (though some, like Sergio, clearly do).

=== Traumatic childhood

Bitcoin started out as a one-man (at least that's what the pseudonym
suggests) project, and bitcoin had little to no value. As such
vulnerabilities and bug fixes were not as rigorously hadled as they
are today.

The Bitcoin wiki has a list of common vulnerabilities and exposures
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[CVEs])
that Bitcoin has gone through.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures

This will be a little expos√© over early security issues and incidents
over the very early years of Bitcoin.

==== 2010-07-28

CVE-2010-5137

Remote crash vulnerability OP_LSHIFT
////

==== 2010-07-28: Spend anyone's coins (CVE-2010-5141)

On July 28 2010, someone discovered a bug in version 0.3.4 that would
let anyone take the coins from anyone. At that time there weren't
nearly as many users as there is today, and the value of bitcoin was
close to zero.

The problem was that the script operator OP_RETURN would simply exit
the program execution, so if the scriptPubKey was `<pubkey>
OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` and scriptSig was `OP_1 OP_RETURN`, the part of the
program in the scriptPubKey would never execute. The only thing that
would happen is that `1` is put on the stack and then `OP_RETURN`
would cause the program to exit. Any non-zero value on top of the
stack after the program has executed means that the spending condition
is fulfilled. And since the top stack element is `1`, the spending
is ok.

This was the code for handling of `OP_RETURN`:

----
            case OP_RETURN:
            {
                pc = pend;
            }
            break;
----

The effect of `pc = pend;` is that the rest of the program is skipped,
which means that any locking script in scriptPubKey was ignored. The
fix was to change the meaning of `OP_RETURN` so that it instead
immediately fails.

----
            case OP_RETURN:
            {
                return false;
            }
            break;
----

Satoshi made this change locally and built an executable binary with
version 0.3.5 from it and posted on Bitcointalk forum "`*** ALERT ***
Upgrade to 0.3.5 ASAP`", urging users to install this binary version
of his, without presenting the source code for it.

[quote, Satoshi Nakamote, Bitcointalk forum]
____
Please upgrade to 0.3.5 ASAP!  We fixed an implementation bug where it was possible that bogus transactions could be accepted.  Do not accept Bitcoin transactions as payment until you upgrade to version 0.3.5!
____

This message was later edited, and is no longer available in its full
form. The above snippet is from a
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=626.msg6458#msg6458[quoting
answer]. Some users tried the binary, but ran into issues with it. And
soon Satoshi wrote

[quote, Satoshi Nakamote, Bitcointalk forum]
____
Haven't had time to update the SVN yet.  Wait for 0.3.6, I'm building
it now.  You can shut down your node in the meantime.
____

And 35 minutes later, he wrote

[quote, Satoshi Nakamote, Bitcointalk forum]
____
SVN is updated with version 0.3.6.

Uploading Windows build of 0.3.6 to Sourceforge now, then will rebuild

____

At this point he also seem to have updated the original post to
mention 0.3.6 instead of 0.3.5:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamote, Bitcointalk forum]
____
Please upgrade to 0.3.6 ASAP!  We fixed an implementation bug where it was possible that bogus transactions could be displayed as accepted.  Do not accept Bitcoin transactions as payment until you upgrade to version 0.3.6!

If you can't upgrade to 0.3.6 right away, it's best to shut down your Bitcoin node until you do.

Also in 0.3.6, faster hashing: +
- midstate cache optimisation thanks to tcatm +
- Crypto++ ASM SHA-256 thanks to BlackEye +
Total generating speedup 2.4x faster.

Download: +
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.6/

Windows and Linux users: if you got 0.3.5 you still need to upgrade to 0.3.6.
____

Note the difference in the characterization of the problem from the
first message: "could be displayed as accepted" vs "could be
accepted". Maybe Satoshi downplayed the severity in his communication,
to not draw too much attention to the actual issue. Anyhow, people
upgraded and it seemed to be working as expected. This particular
issue was resolved, amazingly with no bitcoin losses.

If this bug response would have plaid out today, it would be
considered a complete shitshow for several reasons:

* Satoshi made a binary-only release of 0.3.5 containing the fix. No
patch or code was provided, maybe as a measure to obfuscate the issue.
* 0.3.5 didn't even work.
* The fix in 0.3.6 was actually a <<historic-upgrades, hard fork>>.

Another debatable thing is whether it's a good or a bad thing that
users were asked to shut down their nodes. This wouldn't be doable
today, but at that time lots of users were actively following the
forums for updates and were usually on top of things. Given that it
was possible to do this, it might have been a sensible thing to do.

==== 2010-08-15 Combined output overflow (CVE-2010-5139)

Mid August 2010, Bitcointalk forum user jgarzik, Jeff Garzik,
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.msg9474#msg9474[discovered
that] a certain transaction at block height 74638 had two outputs of
unusually high value:

____
The "value out" in this block #74638 is quite strange:

----

...
  "out" : [
      {
          "value" : 92233720368.54277039,
          "scriptPubKey" : "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 0xB7A73EB128D7EA3D388DB12418302A1CBAD5E890 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
      },
      {
          "value" : 92233720368.54277039,
          "scriptPubKey" : "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 0x151275508C66F89DEC2C5F43B6F9CBE0B5C4722C OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG"
      }
  ]
...
----
92233720368.54277039 BTC?  Is that UINT64_MAX, I wonder?
____

Apparently, the two int64 (not uint64 as Garzik pondered) outputs' sum
would overflow to a negative value -0.00997538 BTC. Whatever the sum
of the inputs, the "sum" of the outputs will be smaller, which makes
this transaction ok according to the current code at the time.

A very unfortunate effect of this is that about 2x92 billion bitcoin
were created, which severely diluted the money supply of about 3.7
million coins that existed at that time.

In a related thread,
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=823.msg9531#msg9531[Satoshi
posted] that he'd appreciate if people stopped mining (or _generating_
as they called it back then).

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcointalk forum]
____
It would help if people stop generating.  We will probably need to
re-do a branch around the current one, and the less you generate the
faster that will be.

A first patch will be in SVN rev 132.  It's not uploaded yet.  I'm
pushing some other misc changes out of the way first, then I'll upload
the patch for this.
____

His plan was to make a soft fork to make transactions like the one
discussed here invalid, and thus invalidationg blocks (especially
block 74638) that contain such transactions. Less than an hour later,
he had committed https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/132/[a patch
in revision 132] of the subversion repository and posted to the forum what he thought users should do:

____
Patch is uploaded to SVN rev 132!

For now, recommended steps: +
1) Shut down. +
2) Download knightmb's blk files.  (replace your blk0001.dat and blkindex.dat files) +
3) Upgrade. +
4) It should start out with less than 74000 blocks. Let it redownload the rest.

If you don't want to use knightmb's files, you could just delete your
blk*.dat files, but it's going to be a lot of load on the network if
everyone is downloading the whole block index at once.

I'll build releases shortly.
____

He wanted people to download block data from a specific user,
knightmb, who had published their blockchain as it appeared on their
disk, in blkXXXX.dat and blkindex.dat files. The reason for
downloading the blockchain data this way, as opposed to resync from
scratch, was said to reduce network bandwidth bottlenecks.

Again, people seemed to go along with this and the reversal of the
invalid block and its successors was successful. The miners started
working on a new successor to block
https://mempool.space/block/0000000000606865e679308edf079991764d88e8122ca9250aef5386962b6e84[74637]
and according to the block's timestamp a successor appeared at 1:53
am, about 8 hours after the issue was detected. At 10:10 AM on August
16 around block 74689, it seems the new chain had overtaken the old
chain, and all non-upgraded nodes reorged to follow the new
chain. This must be the deepest reorg, around 52 blocks, in Bitcoin's
history to date.

Compared to the OP_RETURN issue, this issue was handled in a
cleaner way:

* No binary-only patch release
* The released software worked as intended
* No hard fork

Users were asked to stop mining during this issue too. You could argue
if this is a good idea or not, but if you're convinced that any blocks
on top of the bad block will eventually get wiped out in a deep reorg,
why would you waste resources on mining doomed blocks?

Given the circumstances, this emergency response was a sensible one.

There's an important difference between this case and the OP_RETURN
case: This case was exploited in the wild and thus a fix could be made
more straight-forward. In the case of OP_RETURN, they had to obfuscate
the fix and make public statements that didn't directly reveas what
the issue was.

[[march2013split]]
==== 2013-03-11 DB locks issue 0.7.2 - 0.8.0 (CVE-2013-3220)

A very interesting an educationally valuable issue surfaced in March
2013. It appeared that the blockchain had split (although the word
"`fork`" is used in the quote below) after block 225429. The details
of this incident was
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki[reported
in BIP50]. The summary says:

[quote, Various Bitcoin Core developers, BIP50]
____
A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than
previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able
to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an
unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain
(from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the
mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as
would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in
total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).

In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild
and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools
would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on
the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8
nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.
____

The quick action that the mining pools BTCGuild and Slush took were
imperative in this emergency. They could tip the majority hash power
over to the pre-0.8 branch of the split, and thus help restore
consensus. This gave developers time to figure out a sustainable fix.

What's also very interesting in this issue is that version 0.7.2 and
earlier version were incompatible with each other, which is explained
in the
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki#root-cause[Root
cause section of BIP50]:

[quote, Various Bitcoin Core developers, BIP50]
____
With the insufficiently high BDB lock configuration, it implicitly had
become a network consensus rule determining block validity (albeit an
inconsistent and unsafe rule, since the lock usage could vary from
node to node).
____

The solution chosen, apart from the immediate actions by two pools to
restore consensus, was to temporarily, for a pre-determined amount of
time

* limit the blocks in terms of both size and locks needed
* patch old versions, 0.7.2 and older, with same new rules and to
  increase the lock limit.

This reduced the risk of consensus failure dramatically, and on May 15
the temporary rules were deactivated in concert across the
network. Note that this deactivation was in effect a hard fork, but it
was not contentious. Furthermore, it was released along with the
preceeding soft fork, so people running the soft-forked software was
aware that it would be followed by a hard fork. Thus, the vast
majority of nodes remained in consensus when the hard fork
activated. Unfortunately, though, a few nodes were lost in the
process.

One might wonder if this would have been doable today. The mining
landscape is more complex today and depending on the hash power on
each side of the split, it might be hard roll out a patch such as the
one in BIP50 quickly enough.

In this situation, the damage had already been done as in the last
issue discussed. 


Mentioned in <<upgrading-risks>>.

Inconsistent BDB lock limit interactions

0.7.2 Inconsistent BDB lock limit interactions (hard fork of itself)

Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild)
quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as
canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice
significant amounts of money.

nodes off the network.

[[bip66-splits]]
==== BIP66

BIP66 is interesting because it both fixes a consensus bug and,
ironically, a temporary blockchain split caused by validationless
mining occurred shortly after it's activation.

BIP66 was a propsal to tighten up the rules for signature encodings in
Bitcoin Script. The
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki#motivation[motivation]
was to be able to parse signatures with other software or libraries
than OpenSSL and even recent versions of OpenSSL. OpenSSL is a library
for general purpose cryptography which was used by Bitcoin Core at
that time. As a side effect, this BIP would reduce the attack surface
for transaction malleability.

===== The splits

When BIP66 was activated, it turned out quite messy because some
miners apperently didn't verify the blocks they try to extend. This is
called validationless mining. An alert message was sent out to Bitcoin
nodes with a link to
https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining[a web page
describing the issue].

[quote,Bitcoin Core developers,Alert information on bitcoin.org]
____
Early morning on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was
reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded
5%) mined an invalid block‚Äìas was an expected
occurrence. Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network
hash rate was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV
mining), and built new blocks on top of that invalid block.
____

The alert page instructed people to wait for 30 more confirmations
than they normally would if they use older versions of Bitcoin Core.

The split mentioned above occured on 2015-07-04 02:10 UTC after block

issue resolved at 03:50 the same day after 6 invalid blocks had been
mined. Unfortunately the same issue happened again the day after on
2015-07-05 21:50, but this time the invalid branch only lasted 3

===== The actual vulnerability

The motivation for BIP66 as mentioned above was not the full
truth. The actual motivation was a much worse issue, that was
disclosed publicly by Pieter Wuille in
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009697.html[an
email to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list]:

[quote,Pieter Wuille on Bitcoin-dev mailing list,Disclosure: consensus bug indirectly solved by BIP66]
____
Hello all,

I'd like to disclose a vulnerability I discovered in September 2014,
which became unexploitable when BIP66's 95% threshold was reached
earlier this month.

## Short description:

A specially-crafted transaction could have forked the blockchain
between nodes:

* using OpenSSL on a 32-bit systems and on 64-bit Windows systems
* using OpenSSL on non-Windows 64-bit systems (Linux, OSX, ...)
* using some non-OpenSSL codebases for parsing signatures
____

The email further lays out the details for how the issue got
discovered and more exactly what caused it. At the end he submitted a
timeline of the events. What's especially interesting in this issue is
an event at which a fix could have been deployed without (even Pieter)
knowing:

[quote,Pieter Wuille on Bitcoin-dev mailing list,Disclosure: consensus bug indirectly solved by BIP66]
____
* 2014-Jul-18: In order to make Bitcoin's signature encoding rules not
depend on OpenSSL's specific parser, I modified the BIP62 proposal to
have its strict DER signatures requirement also apply to version 1
transactions. No non-DER signatures were being mined into blocks
anymore at the time, so this was assumed to not have any impact. See
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/90 and
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2014-July/006299.html.
Unknown at the time, but if deployed this would have solved the
vulnerability.
____

And then, OpenSSL released new versions with patches that, if used
from the beginning, would also have solved the issue, but in this case
would make it worse. Gregory Maxwell
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-January/007097.html[explains
this] in another email thread in January 2015:

[quote,Gregory Maxwell on OpenSSL upgrade,Bitcoin-dev mailing list]
____
While for most applications it is generally acceptable to eagerly
reject some signatures, Bitcoin is a consensus system where all
participants must generally agree on the exact validity or
invalidity of the input data.  In a sense, consistency is more
important than "correctness".

...

The patches above, however, only fix one symptom of the general
problem: relying on software not designed or distributed for
consensus use (in particular OpenSSL) for consensus-normative
behavior.  Therefore, as an incremental improvement, I propose
a targeted soft-fork to enforce strict DER compliance soon,
utilizing a subset of BIP62.
____

He points out that using code that's not intended for use in consensus
systems poses serious risks, and proposes that Bitcoin implementes
strict DER encoding.

.Author's speculation
****
From reading this, it gives me the impression that Gregory Maxwell
knew about the vulnerability Pieter Wuille later published, but wanted
to sneak in a fix, dressed as a precaution measure, without drawing
too much attention to the actual problem.
****

Then BIP66 was created as a subset of BIP62 that specified only strict
DER encoding. This BIP was apparently broadly accepted and deployed in
July, albeit the above mentioned splits ironically occured.

The events that led up to BIP66 and its deployment is a very good case
study for how careful Bitcoin developers have to be. A few takeaways from BIP66:

* The balance between openness and not publishing a vulnerability is a
delicate one.
* Deploying fixes for non-published vulnerabilities is a tricky game
  to play.
* Retaining consensus is hard.
* Software not intended for consensus systems are generally dangerous.

* Fix for malleability
* Fix for possible consensus failure (undisclosed when BIP66 implementation was released)
** Disclosure: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009697.html
** A specially-crafted transaction could have forked the blockchain between nodes:
*** using OpenSSL on a 32-bit systems and on 64-bit Windows systems
*** using OpenSSL on non-Windows 64-bit systems (Linux, OSX, ...)
*** using some non-OpenSSL codebases for parsing signatures

Ironically, the fix actually was part in a split, but not due to
signature encodings being incompatible between nodes, but due to
validationless mining.

Gregory Maxwell on infamous OP_CHECKMULTISIG bug

Thoughts from Jonas (https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/btcphilosophy/issues/5):

If bitcoin was broken, we would find out quickly (see 0.8 BDB to LevelDB hardfork).

And if some underlying crypto was broken we'd find out as well (maybe add an aside on post-quantum).

And for fun throw in the Peter Todd pi√±atas.
