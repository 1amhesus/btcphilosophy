== Privacy

This chapter deals with how to keep your private financial information
to yourself. We'll learn what privacy means in the context of Bitcoin,
why it's important, and what it means that Bitcoin is
pseudonymous. We'll look into how private data can leak, both from the
blockchain and off-chain. We then talk about how bitcoins should be
fungible, meaning interchangeable for other bitcoins, and how
fungibility and privacy go hand in hand. Last, we'll go through some
things you can do to improve your, and others' privacy.

Bitcoin can be described as a pseudonymous, explained soon in
<<pseudonymity>>, system where users have multiple pseudonyms in the
form of public keys. At first glance, this looks like a pretty good
way to keep users from being identified, but it is in fact, really
easy to leak private financial information unintentionally.

=== What does privacy mean?

Privacy can mean different things in different contexts. In
Bitcoin, it generally means that users don't have to reveal their
financial information to others unless they voluntarily do so.

There are many ways in which you may leak your private information
to others, with or without knowing it. Data can leak both from the
public blockchain and through other means, for example, by intercepting
your internet communication.

=== Why is privacy important?

It may seem obvious why privacy is important in Bitcoin, but there are
privacy aspects you might not immediately think about. Gregory
Maxwell,
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908[on
the Bitcoin Talk forum], walks us through a lot of good reasons why he
thinks privacy matters. Among them is <<fungibility,fungibility>>:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Talk forum]
____
Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin:
if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their
fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then
we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of
stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully
check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that
fail.  Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various
authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with
bad coins. This adds friction and transactional costs and makes
Bitcoin less valuable as a money.
____

Maxwell also explains how privacy is important for a free market, your
personal safety, and human dignity.

[[pseudonymity]]
=== Pseudonymity

We mentioned above that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, and that the
pseudonyms are public keys, or addresses. In the media you often hear
that Bitcoin is anonymous, which is not correct. There is a
distinction between anonymity and pseudonymity.

Andrew Poelstra
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/29473/69518[explains in a Bitcoin
Stack Exchange post] what anonymity would look like:

[quote,Andrew Poelstra on anonymity,Bitcoin Stack Exchange]
____
Total anonymity, in the sense that when you spend money there is no
trace of where it came from or where it's going, is theoretically
possible by using the cryptographic technique of zero-knowledge
proofs.
____

It seems like the difference is that in a pseudonymous money you can
trace payments between pseudonyms, whereas in an anonymous money you
can't. Since bitcoin payments are tracable between pseudonyms, it's
not anonymous.

We have also said that the pseudonyms are public keys, but it's
actually addresses derived from public keys. Why do we use addresses
as pseudonyms and not something else, for example some descriptive
names, like "`watchme1984`"? This is
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/25175/69518[well explained] by
user Tim S., also on Bitcoin Stack Exchange:

[quote,Tim S. on pseudonyms,Bitcoin Stack Exchange]
____
In order for Bitcoin's idea to work, you must have coins that can only
be spent by the owner of a given private key. This means that whatever
you send to must be tied, in some way, to a public key.

Using arbitrary pseudonyms (e.g. user names) would mean that you'd
have to then somehow link the pseudonym to a public key in order to
enable public/private key crypto. This would remove the ability to
securely create addresses/pseudonyms offline (e.g. before someone
could send money to the user name "tdumidu", you'd have to announce in
the blockchain that "tdumidu" is owned by public key "a1c...", and
include a fee so others have a reason to announce it), reduce
anonymity (by encouraging you to reuse pseudonyms), and needlessly
bloat the size of the blockchain. It would also create a false sense
of security that you're sending to who you think you are (if I take
the name "Linus Torvalds" before he does, then it's mine and people
might send money thinking they're paying the creator of Linux, not
me).
____

Using addresses, or public keys, removes the need to somehow register
a pseudonym beforehand, reduces incentives for pseudonym reuse, avoids
blockchain bloat, and makes impersonating other people hard.

=== Blockchain privacy

Blockchain privacy refers to the information you disclose in
transactions on the blockchain. It can be transactions you make or
transactions other people make to send you money.

Satoshi Nakamoto ponders around on-chain privacy in section 7 of his
https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin paper]:

[[satoshi-unique-addresses]]
[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin paper]
____
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each
transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some
linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The
risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal
other transactions that belonged to the same owner.
____

The paper summarizes the main problems of blockchain privacy: Address
reuse and address clustering. The latter is the ability to decide,
with some level of certainty, that a set of different addresses belong
to the same user.

Chris Belcher
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy[wrote in
great detail] about the different kinds of privacy leaks that can
happen on the Bitcoin blockchain. We recommend you to read at least
the first few subsections under "Blockchain attacks on privacy."

The takeaway is that privacy in Bitcoin isn't perfect. It requires a
significant amount of work to transact privately. Most people aren't
prepared to go that far for privacy. It seems there is a clear
trade-off between privacy and usability.

Another aspect of privacy is that your own privacy measures affect other
users as well. If you are sloppy with your privacy, other people might
experience reduced privacy too. Gregory Maxwell explains this in a
simple manner on the same Bitcoin Talk discussion
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3589252#msg3589252[that
we linked above], and concludes with an example:

[quote, Gregory Maxwell, Bitcoin Talk forum]
____
This actually works in practice, too... A nice whitehat hacker on IRC
was playing around with brainwallet cracking and hit a phrase with
~250 BTC in it.  We were able to identify the owner from just the
address alone, because they'd been paid by a Bitcoin service that
reused addresses and he was able to talk them into giving up the users
contact information. He actually got the user on the phone, they were
shocked and confused— but grateful to not be out their coin.  A happy
ending there. (This isn't the only example of it, by far ... but its
one of the more fun ones).
____

In this case, all went well thanks to the philanthropically minded
hacker, but don't count on that next time.

=== Non-blockchain privacy

While the blockchain proves to be a notorious source of privacy leaks,
there are plenty of other leaks that don't use the blockchain, some
sneakier than others. These range from key-loggers to network traffic
analysis. To read up on some of these methods, please refer again to
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Non-blockchain_attacks_on_privacy[Chris
Belcher's piece], specifically the section "Non-blockchain attacks on
privacy".

Among a plethora of attacks, Belcher mentions the possibility of
someone snooping on your internet connection, for example, your ISP:

[quote, Chris Belcher, Bitcoin wiki]
____
If the adversary sees a transaction or block coming out of your node
which did not previously enter, then it can know with near-certainty
that the transaction was made by you or the block was mined by you. As
internet connections are involved, the adversary will be able to link
the IP address with the discovered bitcoin information.
____

[[kycdbs]]
However, among the most obvious privacy leaks are exchanges. Due to
laws, usually referred to as KYC (know your customer) and AML
(anti-money laundering), in the jurisdictions they operate in,
exchanges and related companies often have to collect personal data
about their users, building up big databases about what users has
which bitcoins. These databases are great honeypots for bad
governments and gangsters who's always on the lookout for new
victims. There are actual markets for this kind of data, where hackers
sell data to the highest bidder. To make things worse, the companies
that manages these databases often have little experience with
protecting financial data, many of them are young startups, and
several leaks have occurred. A few examples are
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/probably-the-largest-kyc-data-leak-in-history-demonstrates-the-importance-of-bitcoin-privacy[India-based
MobiQwik] and
https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/hubspot-security-breach-leaks-bitcoin-users-data[HubSpot]

Again, protecting against this wide range of attacks is hard, and you
probably won't fully be able to, so you have to use some trade-off between
convenience and privacy that works for you.

[[fungibility]]
=== Fungibility

Fungibility was briefly touched upon in
<<whyprivacyimportant>>. Fungibility means that one coin is
interchangeable for any other coin of the same currency. Adam Back and
Matt Corallo
https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/milan-2016/fungibility-overview/[gave
a presentation about fungibility] at Scaling Bitcoin in Milan
2016. Back remarked

[quote, Matt Corallo and Adam Back, Fungibility Overview]
____
You need fungibility for bitcoin to function. If you receive coins and
can’t spend them, then you start to doubt whether you can spend
them. If there are doubts about coins you receive, then people are
going to go to taint services and check whether “are these coins
blessed” and then people are going to refuse to trade. What this does
is it transitions bitcoin from a decentralized permissionless system
into a centralized permissioned system where you have an “IOU” from
the blacklist providers.
____

He speaks here of the dangers of lack of fungibility. A UTXOs
history can usually be traced back several hops, fanning out to
multitudes of previous outputs. If any of those outputs were
involved in something illegal, unwanted, or suspicious activity, then
some potential recipients of your coin might reject it. If you think
that your payees will verify your coins against some centralized
whitelist or blacklist service, you might start checking coins you
receive too, just to be on the safe side. So bad fungibility will
bolster even worse fungibility.

Privacy and fungibility go hand-in-hand. Fungibility will weaken if privacy is
weak, for example, because coins from unwanted persons can become blacklisted.
Privacy will weaken if fungibility is weak since you have to ask the blacklist
providers about which coins to accept, possibly revealing your IP address,
email address, and other sensitive information. They're so intertwined that
it's hard to talk about them in isolation.

[[privacymeasures]]
=== Privacy measures

Several techniques have been developed that help protect from privacy
leaks. Among the most obvious ones are, as
<<satoshi-unique-addresses,noted by Nakamoto>> above, using unique
addresses for all transactions, but several others exist. We're not
going to teach you how to become a privacy ninja. However, Bitcoin Q+A has
a quick summary of privacy-enhancing technology, somewhat ordered by
how hard they are to implement, at
https://bitcoiner.guide/privacytips/. You'll notice when you read this
that Bitcoin privacy often has to do with stuff outside of Bitcoin;
for example: don't brag about your bitcoins, and use Tor and VPN. The
post also lists some things directly related to Bitcoin:

Full node:: if you don't use your own full node, you will leak lots of
information about your wallet to servers on the internet. Running a
full node is a great first step.

Lightning Network:: Several protocols exist on top of Bitcoin, for
example, the Lightning Network and Blockstream's Liquid sidechain.

CoinJoin:: a way for multiple people to merge their transactions into
one, making it harder to do address clustering.

In
https://btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/breaking-bitcoin-privacy/[a
talk] at the Breaking Bitcoin conference, Chris Belcher gave an
interesting example of how privacy has been improved in practice.

[quote,Chris Belcher in "Breaking Bitcoin Privacy", Breaking Bitcoin conference 2019]
____
They were a bitcoin casino. Online gambling is not allowed in
the US. Any customers of Coinbase that deposited straight to Bustabit
would have their accounts shutdown because Coinbase was monitoring for
this. Bustabit did a few things. They did something called change
avoidance where you go through– and you see if you can construct a
transaction that has no change output. This saves miner fees and also
hinders analysis. Also, they imported their heavily-used reused
deposit addresses into joinmarket. At this point, coinbase.com
customers never got banned. It seems Coinbase’s surveillance service
was unable to do the analysis after this, so it is possible to break
these algorithms.
____

He also mentioned this example, among others, on the
https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy[Privacy page] on the Bitcoin wiki.

Note how better privacy can be achieved by building systems on top of
Bitcoin, as is the case with Lightning Network:

.Layers on top of Bitcoin can add privacy.
image::privacy.png[width=50%]

We noted in <<trustlessness,Trustlessness>> that trust can only increase with layers
on top, but that doesn't
seem to be the case for privacy, which can be improved or made worse
arbitrarily in layers on top. Why is that?

Any layer on top of Bitcoin, as explained in
<<_layered_scaling,Layered scaling>>, must use on-chain transactions
now and then, otherwise, it wouldn't be "on top of
Bitcoin". Privacy-enhancing layers generally try to use the base layer
as little as possible to minimize the amount of information revealed.

The above are somewhat technical ways to improve your privacy. But
there are other ways. At the beginning of this chapter, we said that
Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system. This means that users in Bitcoin
aren't known by their real names or other personal data, but by their
public keys. A public key is a pseudonym for a user, and a user can
have multiple pseudonyms. In an ideal world, your in-person identity
is decoupled from your Bitcoin pseudonyms. Unfortunately, due to the
privacy problems described in this chapter, this decoupling usually
degrade over time.

To mitigate the risks of having your personal data revealed is to not
give it out in the first place or not give it to centralized services
that <<kycdbs,build big databases>> that can leak. An article by
Bitcoin Q+A https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/[explains KYC] and the
dangers with it. It also suggests some things you can do to improve
your situation.

[quote,"Bitcoin Q+A, noKYC only, Avoid the creep", bitcoiner.guide]
____
Thankfully there are some options out there to purchase Bitcoin via no
KYC sources. These are all P2P (peer to peer) exchanges where you are
trading directly with another individual and not a centralised third
party. Unfortunately some sell other coins as well as bitcoin so we
urge you to take care.
____

The article suggest you can avoid using exchanges that require KYC/AML
and instead trade in private, or use decentralized exchanges like
https://bisq.network/[bisq].

For more in-depth reading about countermeasures, refer to the
previously mentioned https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Methods_for_improving_privacy_.28non-blockchain.29[wiki article on privacy], starting at "Methods for improving privacy (non-blockchain)".

=== Conclusion

Privacy is very important but hard to achieve. There is no privacy
silver bullet. To get decent privacy in Bitcoin, you have to take
active measures, some of which are costly and time-consuming.
