ongoing maintenance cost which is perpetual and can never be removed
without potentially confiscating some user's assets."

Greg Maxwell on decentralization
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ddddfl/question_on_the_vulnerability_of_bitcoin/f2g9e7b/
"A far bigger risk to Bitcoin is that the public using it won't
understand, won't care, and won't protect the decentralization
properties that make it valuable over centralized alternatives in the
first place. ... a risk we can see playing out constantly in the
billion dollar market caps of totally centralized systems. The ability
demonstrated by system with fake decentralization to arbitrarily
change the rules out from under users is far more concerning than the
risk that an expensive attack could allow some theft in the case of
over-eagerly finalized transactions."

And if you want to change the bitcoin logo to a purple elephant and
denominate coins in 'fluppydoodleblurz' from now on, go ahead and
release a wallet that does that, use that on your sites, make a
BIP, etc. By nature, bitcoin is permissionless.

1335905812|1|gmaxwell|I don't agree with you on that point. Trying to use checkpoints to stop reorgs makes things much worse.  Persistent (unrecoverable) splitting is probably the worse possible outcome— worse than one shot fradulent multi-spending... and it's completely precluded by the current design.

1335905865|1|gavinandresen|A split less than 100 blocks deep is not a problem for anybody unless there are double-spends on the two forks.
1335905909|1|gmaxwell|In order to make such a mechnism safe from preventing non-trivial persistent splits you need an agreement mechinism on the checkpoints. Our options are either to (quasi)centeralize it which removes the attractiveness of bitcoin, or to use distributed consensus for it and in that case the distributed consensus has the same attack vulnerabilities.
