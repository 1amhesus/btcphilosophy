== Adversarial thinking

When we discuss security in various systems, it's good to understand
what the security assumptions are. A typical security assumption in
Bitcoin is "the Discrete Logarithm problem is hard to solve", which,
simply put, means it's _practically_ impossible to find a private key
that corresponds to a certain public key. Another, pretty strong,
security assumption is that a majority of the network's hashpower are
honest, meaning that they play by the rules. If these assumptions are
proven wrong, Bitcoin is in trouble.

Andrew Poelstra
https://btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong-2015/security-assumptions/[made
a talk] at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong 2015, where he
talked about Bitcoin's security assumptions. He says that many systems
disregard adversaries to some extent, for example it's really hard to
protect a building against all types of adversarial events, instead we
accept that someone may burn the building down, and we prevent
adversarial behavior to some extent through law enforcement etc.
// See greg maxwell's analogy of the building: https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2799

But online things are different:

However, online we don’t have this. We have pseudonymous and anonymous
behavior, anyone can connect to everyone and hurt the system. If it’s
possible to adversarially hurt the system, then they will do it. We
cannot assume they will be visible and that they will be caught.
____

The consequence is that all known weaknesses in Bitcoin must be taken
care of somehow, otherwise they will be exploited.

Poelstra goes on to mention how Bitcoin is a new kind of system, which
is more nebulous than for example a signing protocol which has very
clear-cut security assumptions.

On his personal blog, software engineer Jameson Lopp,
https://blog.lopp.net/bitcoins-security-model-a-deep-dive/[dives into this]:

[quote, Jameson Lopp, Bitcoin’s Security Model: A Deep Dive]
____
In reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a
formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can
do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system
in order to better understand and attempt to describe it.
____

So we have a system that seems to be working in practice, but we can't
formally prove it's secure. A proof is probably not possible due to
the complexity of the system.

=== Adversarial thinking for plebs

The importance of adversarial thinking probably extends to the general
public as well to some
degree. https://bitcoinwords.github.io/tweetstorm-on-adversarial-thinking[Ragnar
Lifthrasir mentions in a tweetstorm] how simpilstic narratives around
Bitcoin, for example "just HODL", can be degrading to Bitcoin and
concludes

[quote, Ragnar Lifthrasir, Twitter]
____
To make Bitcoin and ourselves stronger we need to think like the
software engineers who contribute to Bitcoin. They peer review,
mercilessly seeking flaws. At their tech events they talk about every
which way a proposal can fail. They think adversarially. They’re
conservative
____

He refers to these simplistic narratives as monomania, meaning that by
focusing only on a single thing, eg "just HODL", you stop thinking
about important stuff like keeping your Bitcoin secure and doing your
best to use Bitcoin in a trustless manner.

=== Threats

There are a lot of known weaknesses in Bitcoin, and many of them are
actively being exploited. To get a glimpse of that, have a look at
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses[the Weaknesses page] on the
Bitcoin wiki. They mention a wide variety of problems, for example
wallet theft and denial-of-service attacks. 

[quote, Various authors, The Bitcion wiki]
____
If an attacker attempts to fill the network with clients that they
control, you would then be very likely to connect only to attacker
nodes. Although Bitcoin never uses a count of nodes for anything,
completely isolating a node from the honest network can be helpful in
the execution of other attacks.
____

These are examples of real threats that need to be taken care of.

.Exerpt from the Simple Sabotage Field Manual

To better understand the minds of an adversary, it might be useful to
get a glimpse into how they might operate. A government body named
Office of Strategic Services, that operated during World War II,
conducted spionage, performed sabotage and propaganda, among other
things, wrote a
https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf[manual]
for their personell on how to sabotage. It's title was "Simple
Sabotage Field Manual" and contained concrete tips on how to
infiltrate the enemy to make their lifes hard. They range from burning
down warehouses to causing wear to drills to decrease the enemy's
efficiency. For example, there is a section about how an infiltrator
can disrupt organizations.

*General Interference with Organisations and Production*

* Organizations and Conferences
1. Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit
short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
2. Make "speeches." Talk as frequently as possible and at great
length. Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of
personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate
"patriotic" comments.
3. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study
and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as
possible — never less than five.
4. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
5. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes,
resolutions.
6. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt
to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
7. Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees
to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in
embarrassments or difficulties later on.
8. Be worried about the propriety of any decision — raise the question
of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction
of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some
higher echelon.

This highlights how a determined state can and will do everything in
their power to destroy their enemy, including breaking it down from
the inside.

Since Bitcoin is a form of money that competes with established fiat
currencies, chances are that states will regard Bitcoin as an enemy.

Eric Voskuil
https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Axiom-of-Resistance[writes
on his Cryptoeconomics wiki page] about what he calls "Axiom of
Resistance":

[quote, Eric Voskuil, Cryptoeconomics wiki]
____
In other words there is an assumption that it is _possible_ for a
system to resist state control. This is not accepted as a fact but
deemed to be a reasonable assumption, due to empirical study of
behavior of similar systems, on which to base the system.

*One who does not accept the axiom of resistance is contemplating an
entirely different system than Bitcoin.* If one assumes it is _not
possible_ for a system to resist state controls, conclusions do not
make sense in the context of Bitcoin - just as conclusions in
spherical geometry contradict Euclidean. How can Bitcoin be
permissionless or censorship-resistant without the axiom? The
contradiction leads one to make obvious errors in an attempt to
rationalize the conflict.
____

What he's saying is basically that only when one assumes it's possible
to create a system that can't be controlled by states is it meaningful
to try.

This means that to work on Bitcoin, you should accept the Axiom of
Resistance, otherwise you'd better spend your time on other
projects. Accepting that axiom helps in focussing your development
efforts on the real problems at hand: coding around state-level
adversaries. In other words, think adversarially.
