=== How is this organized?

The project is sectioned into topics. Each topic will guide you
through a number of links with recommended reading and briefly discuss
each link.

The links refer to external resources on platforms we can't
control. We have therefore saved the linked articles locally in this
repository, along with info on where it was copied from, and when.

=== What to expect

There are lots and lots of people involved in Bitcoin and they
sometimes have opposing opinions on some topics, so some resources may
appear contradictory others. However, we will mostly try to stick to
the facts, where opinions don't matter.

It should help the reader to more quickly get up to speed
