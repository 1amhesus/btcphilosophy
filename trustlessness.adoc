= Trustlessness

People often say things like "Bitcoin is great because it's
trustless". What do they mean by that? Pieter Wuille explains this
widely used term on StackExchange
(https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/45674/69518).

____
The trust we're talking about in "trustless" is an abstract technical
term. A distributed system is called trustless when it does not
require any trusted parties to function correctly.
____

In short, the word _trustless_ refers to a property of the Bitcoin
protocal, that means it can function without "any trusted
parties". This is different from the trust that you inevitably have to
put into the software or hardware you run.

Bitcoin is thus trustless, but you still have to trust your software
or hardware to some degree. Very advanced users can verify a lot of
aspects of the software they run, and reduce their needed trust to
just trusting their computer hardware, and possibly their operating
system.

Bitcoin's trustlessness is absolutely imperative. In 2018, Matt
Corallo, spoke about trustlessness at the Baltic Honeybadger
conference in Riga.

The essence of that talk was that you can't build trustless systems on
top of a trusted system, but you can build trusted systems, for
example a custodial wallet, on top of a trustless system.

.A trustless base layer allows for various trade-offs on higher levels.

This security model allows the system designer to select trade-offs
that make sense to them, without forcing those trade-offs on others.
