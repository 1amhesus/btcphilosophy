== Trustlessness

People often say things like "Bitcoin is great because it's
trustless". What do they mean by trustless? Pieter Wuille explains
this widely used term on https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/45674/69518[Stack Exchange]:

____
The trust we're talking about in "trustless" is an abstract technical
term. A distributed system is called trustless when it does not
require any trusted parties to function correctly.
____

In short, the word _trustless_ refers to a property of the Bitcoin
protocol, that means it can logically function without "any trusted
parties". This is different from the trust that you inevitably have to
put into the software or hardware you run. More on this trust further
down this article.

To use Bitcoin in a trustless manner, you have to run a full Bitcoin
node. Without that, you outsource verification of Bitcoin data to
someone else, and thus trust someone else which means you're not using
Bitcoin trustlessly.

Bitcoin's trustlessness is absolutely imperative from a system
perspective. In 2018, Matt Corallo, https://btctranscripts.com/baltic-honeybadger/2018/trustlessness-scalability-and-directions-in-security-models/[spoke about trustlessness] at the
Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga.

The essence of that talk was that you can't build trustless systems on
top of a trusted system, but you can build trusted systems, for
example a custodial wallet, on top of a trustless system.

.A trustless base layer allows for various trade-offs on higher levels.

This security model allows the system designer to select trade-offs
that make sense to them, without forcing those trade-offs on others.

=== Don't trust, verify

Bitcoin is trustless, but you still have to trust your software or
hardware to some degree. That's because your software or hardware
might not be programmed to do what's stated on the box. For example:

* The CPU is maliciously programmed to detect private key
  cryptographic operations and leak the private key data.
* the operating system's random number generator might not be as
  random as it claims.
* Bitcoin Core might have sneaked in code that will send your private
  keys to some bad actor.

So besides running a full node, you also need to make sure you're
running what you intend to. There's a mantra, that many Bitcoiners
subscribe to, which captures this well:

This alludes to the phrase
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify[trust, but verify]"
that former U.S. president Ronald Reagan used in the context of
nuclear
disarmament. https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/1491415722123153408?s=20&t=ZyROxZxlBppdRpuuzsiF5w[Bitcoiners
switched it around to highlight the rejection of trust and the
importance of running a full node].

Some users <<adversarialthinking, think adversarially>> and verify a
lot of aspects of the software they run, and reduce their needed trust
to just trusting their computer hardware, and possibly their operating
system. In doing so they also help people who don't verify as
thoroughly by raising their voices in public to warn about the issues
they find. One good example of this is an
https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/[event that occurred
2018], where a bug was discovered that would allow miners to spend an
output twice in the same transaction:

[quote, CVE-2018-17144 Full Disclosure, Bitcoin Core website]
____
CVE-2018-17144, a fix for which was released on September 18th in
Bitcoin Core versions 0.16.3 and 0.17.0rc4, includes both a Denial of
Service component and a critical inflation vulnerability. It was
originally reported to several developers working on Bitcoin Core, as
well as projects supporting other cryptocurrencies, including ABC and
Unlimited on September 17th as a Denial of Service bug only, however
we quickly determined that the issue was also an inflation
vulnerability with the same root cause and fix.
____

Here an anonymous person reported an issue that turned out much worse
than the reporter realized, but the lesson here is that people who
verify the code often report security flaws, instead of exploiting
them. This is of great help for people who aren't able to verify
everything themselves. However, users should not trust others to keep
them safe, but should verify when and what they can, that's how you
remain as sovereign as possible and how Bitcoin prospers, and the more
eye-balls on the software the less likely it is that security flaws
slip through.
