= Note to reviewers

Thank you so much for reviewing this work. The things we're most
interested in are:

* Factual errors
* Severe omissions
* Language (We're Swedes, any help here is useful)
* Structural improvements

Other kinds of input is of course helpful too, but we might not handle
it promptly due to time restrictions.

We prefer to receive the feedback as Github issues or even better as pull requests,
but any means will do.
